# shuffle-simulations
The faro shuffle is a seemingly impossible act of card manipulation, being able to mix up a deck of cards and then return it back to its original order. Beyond card magic the faro is known to have applications to divide-and-conquer algorithms, popping up in implementations of Fast Fourier Transforms, in sorting algorithms and in recursive addition algorithms. (For details, see the papers "Parallel Processing with the Perfect Shuffle" by Stone and "The Mathematics of Perfect Shuffles" by Diaconis, Graham and Kantor.)

The paper "Perfect and Semi-Perfect Shuffles" in this repository looks at previously unknown shuffles intimately related to the faro, and the mathematics behind them. I am not yet sure if the new shuffles have applications beyond what can be done with regular faros, but they serve as a novel discovery.

Code to simulate the action of the shuffles has been included.
