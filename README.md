# shuffle-simulations
The faro shuffle is a seemingly impossible act of card manipulation, being able to mix up a deck of cards and then return it back to its original order. The paper "Perfect and Semi-Perfect Shuffles" in this repository looks at related techniques and the mathematics behind them. Code to simulate the action of the shuffles has also been included.

The faro shuffle is known to have applications to divide-and-conquer algorithms, popping up in implementations of Fast Fourier Transforms, in sorting algorithms and in recursive addition algorithms. (For details, see the papers "Parallel Processing with the Perfect Shuffle" by Stone and "The Mathematics of Perfect Shuffles" by Diaconis, Graham and Kantor.)
